![](https://github.com/LEoPart-X/LEoPart/workflows/C/C++%20CI/badge.svg)

LEoPart-x (**L**agrangian-**E**ulerian **o**n **Part**icles-x) integrates
particle functionality into the open-source finite element library
[DOLFINx](https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx), a component of
[the FEniCS project](www.fenicsproject.org).

LEoPart-x is developed and tested against
[DOLFINx `v0.7.2`](https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx/releases/tag/v0.7.2).
